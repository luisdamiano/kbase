** What is a good guide for Slurm?

   This is an excellent guide: [[https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/slurm][Introducing Slurm | Princeton Research Computing]].
   It covers how to submit serial jobs, multithreaded jobs, multinode or
   parallel MPI jobs, multinode, multithreaded jobs, job arrays, running
   multiple jobs in parallel as a single job, and running a sequence of jobs
   (job dependencies).
