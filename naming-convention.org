* Naming convention

** Common guidelines

   - Name things mainly for their role, sometimes for their type
   - Variable names follow mathematical notation only in low-level
     functions, use meaningful name for user facing variables
   - Use unabbreviated verbs for function names
   - Keep abbreviations between 3 and 4 chars
