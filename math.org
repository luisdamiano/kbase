*** How to choose $u$ and $dv$ in integration by parts?

    We pick $u$ and $dv$ from an expression of the form $\int f(x) g(x) dx$. We
    need to differentiate $u$ and integrate $dv$.

    - Consider $dv = f$ for $f$ the most complex expression in the
      integrand among all those with known integral
    - Consider $u = f$ if $\int f dx$ is not known
    - Consider $u = f$ when $df$ is nicer to work with than $\int f$
    - Typical choices are $u = f$ when $f$ is a logarithmic, inverse
      trigonometric, algebraic, trigonometric, or exponential function.

** Fourier basis functions
   An orthonormal basis for $L^2([0,1], \mathcal{R})$ is $1, 2\sqrt{cos(2\pi
   nx)},2â€“\sqrt{sin(2\pi nx)}$ for $x\in[0, 1]$ and $n = 1,2,\dots$

** Computer Assisted Algebra (CAS)

   As with any software, for Computer Assisted Algebra I try to use open source
   software as much as possible. I keep the use of Wolfram Alpha and Wolfram
   Mathematica to a minimum.
