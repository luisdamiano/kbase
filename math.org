** How to choose $u$ and $dv$ in integration by parts?

   We pick $u$ and $dv$ from an expression of the form $\int f(x) g(x) dx$. We
   need to differentiate $u$ and integrate $dv$.

   - Consider $dv = f$ for $f$ the most complex expression in the
     integrand among all those with known integral
   - Consider $u = f$ if $\int f dx$ is not known
   - Consider $u = f$ when $df$ is nicer to work with than $\int f$
   - Typical choices are $u = f$ when $f$ is a logarithmic, inverse
     trigonometric, algebraic, trigonometric, or exponential function.
