* Scientific communication

  [[https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22it+can+be+understood+through+thorough+thought+though%22&t=h_&ia=web][English is weird but it can be understood through thorough thought though]].
  Communication is as hard as it gets. There's a trade-off between message
  length, precision, ease of reading, and understandability. I thrive for short
  and precise sentences that are easy to digest that are modular yet feel
  complete. Here's a couple notes for better writting.

** General resources
   - The Elements of Style by Strunk, W., Jr. and White, E.B. An
     opinionated style guide.
   - The Chicago Manual of Style (15th ed.), Chicago: University of
     Chicago Press.

** Academic phrases

** No adjectives allowed

   - Good, best, better: in what sense?
   - Difficult: what are you trying to say more precisely? What's the
     complexity?

** Use technical terms

   - List of technical names used frequently and short sentences
   - Emulator, surrogate, meta-model, statistical model _versus_
     computer experiment, computer model, mechanistic model, physical
     model, climate model, what have you
   - /Significant(ly)/ has a technical connotation, use /considerable/
     or /considerably/ if one want to avoid such connotation
   - A vector/scalar(-valued) function of a vector/scalar variable (greenbagels
     at Libera.Chat). A function of a vector variable, associated with
     [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus][multivariate calculus]], depends on the domain of the function. A
     [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector-valued_function][vector-valued]] or scalar-valued function, associated with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus][vector calculus]],
     depends on the range of the function.

** Repeat technical terms, no synonyms

   - Prefer repeating a technical term in the same sentence, or a
     sequence of sentences, rather than using synonyms that are not
     defined.

** Repeat the technical terms when in doubt

   Yeah, it sounds weird to be repetitive and I sometimes feel that I
   keep repeting myself too much. As a reader, though, I sometimes
   wish the writter would be more _precise_ even at the price of
   repetition. Even thought a section might be about a specific
   density function (e.g., predictive density), make sure that in
   every sentence it is obvious that you are referring to that
   density and not to any of the dozen densities that a model have
   and are highly connected to the density you are talking about.

** Attributive nouns

   They are tough to beat. In most situations, I prefer an extensive
   use of attributive nouns. Be ware they grow too big too often; I
   sometimes break a really long chain of nouns into two smaller
   attribute noun clauses.

   Compare /the benefit of the parametrization that we propose for
   this model/ versus /the proposed model parametrization benefit/.

** Prefer short precise terms over phrases
   - /multiple/ instead of /more than one/

** Getting determiners right

** Double negation is not an affirmation

   Litotes help moderate an adjective, e.g., not unlike vs like, not uncommon vs
   common, non-trivial vs complex. "Not unlike" is slightly different than
   saying "like" much like saying "I love apples" is not the same thing as
   saying "I don't hate apples."

** Verb tenses
   I sometimes doubt about the /right/ verb tense for a sentence. When I read, I
   often see authors changing tenses often, perhaps with a good reason. Here a
   few thoughts.

   - Active voice
     - I don't have a reference to use, but I've seen a pushback against the
       traditional use of passive voice. It's probably a good idea to stick to
       either active or passive voice throughout the manuscript.
   - Present tense
     - Facts that are always true, e.g., a Gaussian process /is/ a probabilistic
       model
   - Present perfect
     - Things that have been done recently, e.g., Author (year)
       /has recently introduced/ a novel framework
   - Past tense
     - Things that were done in the past, e.g., Author (year) /built/ a
       parametric function

** My own common tics to grep for
   - Hyphens are used when two or more adjectives or an adjective and
     a noun together modify another noun; for example, goodness-of-fit
     test is the equivalent of test for goodness of fit.
   - Most words with prefixes such as sub, non, pre, post are not hyphenated,
     for example: subtable, nonnormal, nonlinear, premultiply, postgraduate.
   - No dash when using the wise suffix, e.g., elementwise instead of
     element-wise, subspace instead of sub-space
   - Closed compound nouns, e.g., metadata instead of meta data
   - Prefer "Considering/As/Since subject verb" over "Considering that subject
     verb" (mdogg at libera.chat)
   - /squared exponential/ is grammatical, /square exponential/ is not
   - /y is quadratic in x/ or /y is a quadratic function of x/, but never /y is quadratic on x/

** Rules of thumb
   - Use "respectively" at the end of the sentence, preferably, or in the
     middle. Use comma.
   - Prefer "and is thus" over "and thus is" (187M vs 24M matches). Consider
     "therefore" or "thence" instead of "thus", which is becoming archaic, for
     causation.
   - Don't be unnecessarily indirect, don't be fluffy. E.g., "Consider"
   - Can/could/may: /can/ expresses certainty, /could/ expresses uncertainty or
     a conditional statement, /may/ expresses a possibility or a permission,
     /may not/ expresses a denial of permission. (The Chicago manual of style,
     2017, 5.250).

** Contextual formatting

   - Use *bold* for (i) make the core of the message as salient as
     possible, (ii) in-line headings at the start of the line
   - Use /emph/, or /italic/ if emph is not available, to mark format
     names or definition concepts
   - Use _underline_ for editing comments that won't make it to the
     final version
   - Use =verbatim= for programming-like keywords, e.g., =gemv=
   - Use ~code~ for in-line code snippets

** Oral presentations

   - A sentence is better than a paragraph. A phrase is better than a
     sentence. A word is better than a phrase. An image is better than
     a word.
   - Have you noticed how hard it is to convey a technical detail
     while giving an oral presentation? Now imagine how hard it is for
     the audience to understand anything too technical. Be a nice
     speaker instead :)
