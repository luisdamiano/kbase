* Research project

  Four git repositories are needed. An overarching repository for the
  project (=project=), and subcomponents for the three elements in the
  research project (=data=, =analytics=, =literature=
  respectively). Possibly use git submodules for the latter.

  - Data: data acquisition and munging, i.e. from raw data to the
    format required downstream
  - Analytics: analyses of the above data
  - Literature: writing based on the above analyses, e.g., abstracts,
    reports, manuscripts, presentations
