** How to select algorithm tolerance for numerical differentiation?

In absence of problem-specific information, use the square root of
machine epsilon for forward difference, and the cubic root of machine
epsilon for centered difference. Finding a minimum gets the square
root of epsilon while finding a root gets epsilon.
