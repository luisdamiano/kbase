  REasonable Default Modus Operandi

  - Reasonable: makes sense without further context
  - Default: helps with automation, but is not the only option
  - Modus Operandi: set of rules


 
  - There's no one ring to rule them all
  - It's guided by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle][Pareto principle]]
  - It's not the final answer but a first step until you can budget
    more time to further look into it
