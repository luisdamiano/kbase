  REasonable Default Modus Operandi

  - Reasonable: makes sense without further context
  - Default: helps with automation, but is not the only option
  - Modus Operandi: set of rules

  - There's no one ring to rule them all
  - It's guided by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle][Pareto principle]]
  - It's not the final answer but a first step until you can budget
    more time to further look into it

** How to measure feature importance?
   PFI + CRPS is a great combo

   - Divide a large data set into relatively large exclusive sub samples
   - Identify blocks of correlated features
   - Run permutation feature importance ny permuting the feature
     blocks
   - Use negative CRPS, negative PPLD, RMSE (in that order) as
     validation statistics
