** How to avoid orphan words?

   Sometimes, we have one or two words hanging on the last line of a
   paragraph.

   - Globally, set a large penalty for creating a club line at bottom of page
     adding =\clubpenalty=10000= ([[https://mirror.mwt.me/ctan/systems/knuth/dist/tex/texbook.tex][source]])
   - Add ~\looseness=-1~ immediately before the paragraph ([[https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/204087/225233][source]])
   - Adjust =badness= limits
   - =\parfillskip= controls the length at the end of a paragraph

** How to prepend letter to figure name?

   #+begin_src latex
     %% Add prefix S to label names
     \renewcommand{\thepage}{S\arabic{page}}
     \renewcommand{\thesection}{S\arabic{section}}
     \renewcommand{\thetable}{S\arabic{table}}
     \renewcommand{\thefigure}{S\arabic{figure}}
     %% Modify the text used at the start of the caption
     \renewcommand{\figurename}{Supplemental Material, Figure}

** How to type a differential operator =dx=?

   Use upright =d= followed by math =x=, and possibly add a space =\,=
   before the differential operator

   #+begin_src latex
     \begin{equation}
       \int_0^1 x^2 \, \mathrm{d}x
     \end{equation}

** How should I type ...?

   - Punctuation
     - add to an inline and displayed equation the punctuation
       required by conventional rules, e.g., question mark, comma,
       semicolon, period
     - add punctuation inside the math mode scope to avoid orphans
   - Fractions
     - prefer horizontal bar or forward slash over
       precomposed fractions for accessibility reasons.
     - metric units are given in decimal fractions, non-metric units
       can be either type of fraction
   - Upright (Roman) versus italic
     - prefer upright over italic for operators,
       e.g., $\mathrm{d}x$ over $dx$
     - but prefer italic over upright for standard universal constants,
       e.g., $e$ over $\mathrm{e}$ and $\pi$ over $\mathrm{\pi}$
     - prefer italic for variable and function names,
     - but prefer upright for multi-letter names, e.g., $\mathrm{log}(x)$
       over $log(x)$ and $\mathrm{sin}(x)$ over $sin(x)$
     - prefer upper case italics for sets
   - Blackboard bold: standard number system and some certain
     mathematical objects
   - Linear algebra:
     - prefer lowercase bold for vectors, uppercase bold for matrices
     - transpose: prefer =\top= for a superscript non-italic capital
       letter T
     - scalar or dot product: prefer center dot =\cdot= over
       juxtaposition
     - inner product: use angle brackets =\langle= and =\rangle=,
       e.g., $\langle \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \rangle$ ([[https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/309027/225233][How to define
       an inner product argument in LaTeX]])

** How to reduce spacing around figures, tables, captions?

   - \textfloatsep — distance between floats on the top or the bottom and the text;
   - \floatsep — distance between two floats;
   - \intextsep — distance between floats inserted inside the page text
   - (using h) and the text proper.
   - \dbltextfloatsep — distance between a float spanning both columns and the text;
   - \dblfloatsep — distance between two floats spanning both columns.
   - \captionsetup{font=footnotesize}

     #+begin_src latex
       % Reduced margins
       \usepackage{geometry}
       \geometry{left=0.75in,right=0.75in,bottom=1in,top=1in}

       % Minimal spacing around captions and floats
       \setlength{\abovecaptionskip}{2pt plus 1pt minus 2pt}
       \setlength{\belowcaptionskip}{2pt plus 1pt minus 2pt}
       \setlength{\textfloatsep}{2pt plus 1pt minus 2pt}
       \setlength{\intextsep}{2pt plus 1pt minus 2pt}
       \setlength{\floatsep}{2pt plus 1pt minus 2pt}

** How to write a good proof in LaTeX?

   - Use the =\proof= environment from the ~amsthm~ package ([[https://texfaq.org/FAQ-proof][source]])
     - Add some text, if needed
     - Begin a =align= environment
       - Use the =aligned= subenvironment within =align=, possibly with a =[t]=
         option, or similar subenvinroments to break long lines ([[https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/74819/225233][source]])
       - Use the =\shortintertext= command from the ~mathtools~ package to write
         short text between lines, or =\intertext= if you prefer larger space
         above and below the math line ([[https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/253913/225233][source]])
       - Use the =\tag= command if you want to refer to a line by a name instead
         of a number

** How to smash all in-line math?

   There is a strong argument for increasing the =linespread= to
   accomodate for =$Y^{(0)}$= if you need to use smash too often. If
   you insist, though, use =\setlength{\lineskiplimit}{-100pt}=

     typesetting tall math]]

** How to influence the position of a figure/table?

   - Low-effort approach: load ~\usepackage[section]{placeins}~ and
     set ~h!~ for placement specifiers. It adds a ~\FloatBarrier~
     ([[https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/88659/225233][more]]) at the end of a section to avoid mixing floats and
     sections.

** How to set a global path for input and graphic files?

   #+begin_src latex
     \makeatletter
     \def\input@path{{/path/to/folder/}}
     % or: \def\input@path{{/path/to/folder/}{/path/to/another/folder/}}
     \makeatother
   #+end_src

** How to align table columns without counting them?

   Say you want to align the first column to the left and the rest to
   the right without needing to figure out how many columns the table
   has. You can specify more columns than used, but not vice-versa, as
   in =l*9r= or =l*{99}=. Use brackets for more than one digit.

   #+begin_src latex
     \begin{tabular}{l*{99}r}
       col1 & col2 \\
     \end{tabular}
   #+end_src

** How to add the (sub)section name in the page header?

   #+begin_src latex
     % Add section name in page header
     \usepackage{fancyhdr}
     \fancypagestyle{main}{
       \fancyhf{}
       \renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{\markright{\thesection\ ##1}}
       \renewcommand{\subsectionmark}[1]{\markright{\thesubsection\ ##1}}
       \renewcommand{\subsubsectionmark}[1]{\markright{\thesubsubsection\ ##1}}
       \fancyhead[L]{\textsl{\footnotesize{\rightmark}}}
     }
     \pagestyle{main}
   #+end_src

** How to hide section headings?

   #+begin_src latex
     \usepackage{titlesec}

     \makeatletter
     \titleformat{\section}[runin]{}{}{0pt}{\@gobble}
     \titleformat{\subsection}[runin]{}{}{0pt}{\@gobble}

     \makeatother
     \titlespacing{\section}{\parindent}{0pt}{0pt}
     \titlespacing{\subsection}{\parindent}{0pt}{0pt}
   #+end_src

** How to change the caption font size?

   #+begin_src latex
     \usepackage{caption}
     \captionsetup{font=footnotesize}
   #+end_src

** How to properly compile a LaTeX project?

   Use =latemk file.tex -pdf= and that's it. No need to run multiple
   commands or figure out the right order. Put in a makefile if that's
   your workflow.

** How to build a custom style?
   - Consider building a class
     - [[https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/clsguide.pdf][LATEX2e for class and package writers]] Sec 2.3
     - Example [[https://github.com/exaexa/manurxiv/blob/master/manurxiv.cls#L20][manurxiv/manurxiv.cls at exaexa/manurxiv]]
     - [[https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/132239/225233][documentclass writing - cls file - multiple files]]

   Mix and match (suggestions for a research paper style):

   - Search for accessibility guidelines
   - A base template for inspiration, e.g., [[https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/icml2021-template/dsftnbmjgyhv][ICML2021 Template]]
   - Layout, e.g., two columns
   - Portrait pages need to be easy to set up
   - Line numbering
   - Author affiliation need to be easy to set up
   - Short title in header/footer
   - Page number in header/footer
   - Headings need to be easy to spot
   - Text font, e.g., libertinus, palladios, see also [[https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/][The LaTeX Font
     Catalogue]]
   - Math font
   - Load AMS packages
   - Reasonably minimal page margins
   - Reasonably minimal fig/table caption margins
   - Allow for fig/table extending over both columns
   - Appendix need to be easy to set up
   - Appendix fig/table numbering should start with A, e.g., Table A.1
   - Option to hide names and acknowledgments
   - Option for a short table of content on front page
   - Have some basic editing commands
     - Logical markup, see [[https://www.ctan.org/pkg/soul][CTAN: Package soul]] (Manual, Sec 5.1)
     - Note box, see [[https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/59342/225233][How to highlight an entire paragraph?]]
   - Recall that not everyone types in English

** What type of LaTeX commands exist?

   - Author commands
     - typically short, lower case names
     - e.g. =\section=, =\emph=, =\times=
   - Class and package writer commands
     - typically long, CamelCase names
     - e.g., =\InputIfFileExists=, =\RequirePackage=, =\PassOptionsToClass=
   - Internal commands
     - typically contain an @ in their name
     - e.g., =\@tempcnta=, =\@ifnextchar= and =\@eha=
   - Exceptions:
     - =\hbox= is internal
     - =\m@ne=, the constant -1, is for class and package writers

** How to make a class color safe?

   - Issue: when using ={\color{green} text}=, color is restored
     after the final =}=
     - e.g., \setbox0=\hbox{\color{green} ⟨text⟩}
   - Use LaTeX box commands rather than TeX primites
     - =\sbox= rather than =\setbox=
     - =\mbox= rather than =\hbox=
     - =\parbox= or a =minipage= environment rather than =\vbox=
   - Use =\normalcolor= to set regions to main document color rather
     like =\normalfont=

** How to write a custom LaTeX class?

   - Use the =doc= software which comes with LaTeX (see The LaTeX companion)

** Where do I put local LaTeX style files and packages?

   The path of the local folder, and many others, are defined in
   =/etc/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf=. The default path for local files is =~/texmf=.
   Packages, .tex and .sty files go in =~/texmf/tex/latex=, bibtex style files
   .bst go in =~/texmf/bibtex/bst/=. Finally, run =texhash ~/texmf/= to update
   the database.
