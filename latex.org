   - \textfloatsep — distance between floats on the top or the bottom and the text;
   - \floatsep — distance between two floats;
   - \intextsep — distance between floats inserted inside the page text
   - (using h) and the text proper.
   - \dbltextfloatsep — distance between a float spanning both columns and the text;
   - \dblfloatsep — distance between two floats spanning both columns.
   - \captionsetup{font=footnotesize}

** How to influence the position of a figure/table?

   - Low-effort approach: load ~\usepackage[section]{placeins}~ and
     set ~h!~ for placement specifiers. It adds a ~\FloatBarrier~
     ([[https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/88659/225233][more]]) at the end of a section to avoid mixing floats and
     sections.
