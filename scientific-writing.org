   You probably want a LaTeX command for these.

   - Citation needed: when you are inclined to accept the
     statement, but still need to pin-point the best reference
   - Verification needed: when you want to double-check that something
     is as stated
   - Revision needed: when you want to review the math or, more
     generally, the logic of the statement
   - Further research needed: when you make a broad statement, typically
     outside the scope of the current writing, that seems worth
     exploring by you or anyone else
   - Discussion needed: when you want to have others opinion

*** Novel methodology with application
    An applied statistics paper driven by a scientific application that requires
    some novel methodology development. The application is interesting enough
    for a subject-matter expert and, most importantly for us, is rich and
    complex enough that demands more than off-the-shelf methodologies.

    - Title: <novel methodology name> with applications to
      <application name>
    - Abstract
      - <application> is increasingly important in <application context>.
        However, <methodology motivation>
      - We propose <novel methodology brief description>. <list of all novel
        elements embeded in the methodology>
      - We demonstrate the methodology in <application brief description> and
        show that <methodology benefits>
    - Introduction
      - <application motivation>, <application state-of-the-art approaches>
      - <where and why state-of-the-art approaches are limited or fail>
      - <methodology benefits>, <methodology key aspects>
      - <paper layout>
    - Data
      - <application background>, which may include <scientific background>,
        <measurement instruments>, <data sources>, <data collection>, <computer
        model description>
      - <limited exploratory data analysess>
      - _Note on notation_: as a general rule, keep notation to a minimum in
        this section and leave as much notation as possible for the methods
        section instead.
    - Methods
      - <notation>
      - <model specification, also known as model formulation>
      - <model selection, comparison>
      - <quantities and statistics of interest>
    - Application
      - Specify what was discussed in methods to what was actually carried out
        for this application (being accurate is important)
      - Discuss the results
        - Discuss estimation, convergence, numerical stability and accuracy
        - Discuss in-sample results, in-sample model selection criteria,
          model interpretation and model-based scientific analys
      - _Note on case study vs application_: case study is more limited
    - Discussion
      - <methodology extensions>: usually short sketches of extensions that are
        not full fledged and were not needed for the application
      - <methodology limitations>
      - <future research>:
        - adjacent methodologies that, in principle, you expect would pair well
          with the current paper methodology
        - adjacent applications that could benefit from the current paper
          methodology

*** Case study
    - Data
    - Models
      - Alternative methods to be compared
      - Include a /straw human/ model
      - Include common pratice models, even if they feel hacky
      - Include state of the art models
    - Evaluation criteria
      - Possibly several criteria
      - Assess the quality of fit
      - Should be aligned with what the model is trying to improve upon
    - Results
      - Qualitative performance based on visualization and intuition
      - Quantiative performance based on the evaluation criteria
