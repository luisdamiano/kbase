* Gaussian processes

** Is the mean function a Gaussian process uninteresting?

   - [[https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume7/micchelli06a/micchelli06a.pdf][Universal kernels]] should be able to approximate any continuous
     functions on a compact subset, making a mean function nonessential
   - The mean function may not live in the space of functions being
     modeled
   - A mean function can help with extrapolation when using a
     nonperiodic kernel

** Is the derivative of a Gaussian process another Gaussian process?

   Since differentiation is a linear operator, the derivative of a
   Gaussian process is another Gaussian process.

** Is the integral of a Gaussian process another Gaussian process?

   If all finite linear combinations $\sum_i a_i X_{t_i}$ are Gaussian
   and the process is continuous, $Y_t = \int_0^t X_s \, \mathrm{d}s$ is a
   Gaussian process.
