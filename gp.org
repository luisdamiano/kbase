* Gaussian processes

** Is the mean function a Gaussian process uninteresting?

   - [[https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume7/micchelli06a/micchelli06a.pdf][Universal kernels]] should be able to approximate any continuous
     functions on a compact subset, making a mean function nonessential
   - The mean function may not live in the space of functions being
     modeled
   - A mean function can help with extrapolation when using a
     nonperiodic kernel

** Is the derivative of a Gaussian process another Gaussian process?

   Since differentiation is a linear operator, the derivative of a
   Gaussian process is another Gaussian process.

** Is the integral of a Gaussian process another Gaussian process?

   If all finite linear combinations $\sum_i a_i X_{t_i}$ are Gaussian
   and the process is continuous, $Y_t = \int_0^t X_s \, \mathrm{d}s$ is a
   Gaussian process.

** Is the convolution of a Gaussian process another Gaussian process?

   The convolution of a Gaussian process, as a linear combination of Gaussia
   nrandom variables, remains a Gaussian process.

** What are the main limitations of a Gaussian process?

   - Computationally impractical for large data sets: inference requires the
     inversion of an $N\times{}N$ covariance matrix, which is $O(N^3)$
     - Use a large data approximation: [[https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2957109][When Gaussian Process Meets Big Data: A
       Review of Scalable GPs]]
   - Covariance function is commonly assumed to be stationary, limiting modeling
     flexiblity (e.g., noise variance is different in differents parts of the
     input space, the function has a discontinuity)
