** How to call Make on all files in a directory?

   Populate the =all= target programatically. For each file with extension
   =ext1=, build a file with the same name but extension =ext2=.

   #+begin_src makefile
     all : $(patsubst %.ext1, %.ext2, $(wildcard *.ext1))
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src makefile
     all : $(patsubst %.tex, %.pdf, $(wildcard *.tex))
   #+end_src
